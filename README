Optical flow Proj. 2399

of:   
     Program that reads two ppm files (time separated images) and computes feature
     motion in terms of i,j displacements. I belive this program is based on this paper:
     http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/pub/brox_eccv04_of.pdf

read_flo_2km_1min.f:
     Program that reads the output from 'of', and computes u- and v-component of the wind.
     However, this program assumes the images are on a rectangular lat/lon equidistant 
     projection (not sure if that's a real projection!), so to compute the u- and v-comp
     only requires a simple multiplication of the i- and j-displacements. As you can 
     tell by the filename, this program assumes the data are at 2km resolution and the 
     images are separated by 1 minute.

     Even though this is a Fortran program, I think you should be able to get an idea
     of the format of the output file. I don't have documentation for the file format;
     perhaps the paper has more info (I haven't looked).

There are two basic functions I need (which I assume you'll code in python):
     1. Given an i,j location in the input image, compute a lat,lon. Initially, let's 
     test this given the image is in a polar stereographic projection. The images, airs1.ppm
     and airs2.ppm, are 1000x1000 centered on the north pole, a standard latitude of 60 degrees,
     normal longitude of 0 degrees, and the pixel spacing at 60 degrees is 4 km.
     
     2. Given an i,j displacement in airs1.flo, calculate u- and v-component or speed and direction
        of the displacement. Delta time is also input, which for this case is 100 minutes.
