pywinds is a python application that finds useful information about the wind from a user given area and a
file containing pixel displacements. The information provided includes wind velocity, the v and u component
of the wind, lat/long of each pixel, and the original pixel displacement data. This information
is then easily accessible from both netcdf and text file formats.

The main function is wind_info.sh
